# D2lImporter

D2L Importer is a simple plugin for Canvas that imports the most useful 
bits of D2L courses into Canvas.  This is meant to be loaded into Canvas
LMS via the plugin architecture.

## Installation

Download the source tree, unzip it, and stick it in the canvas plugins directory.

## Usage

Ideally once this is all working you'll be able to import things from D2L
by using the built in converter.

## Development

Development is really similar to developing for Canvas.  Check out [their docs](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/tree/stable/doc)
 to get started developing this. Once that's all setup, you should be all set.
